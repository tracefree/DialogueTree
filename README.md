# DialogueTree
An example of how to use Godot's GraphEdit node for a visual dialogue system.

This is a zero-effort release of the dialogue system I use in my game. It is not documented, will not receive updates, and doesn't function on its own - you need to integrate it with your own dialogue UI system, actor class, inventory system, quest system etc. The purpose of the release is to give an example of how the `GraphEdit` node can be used, and I encourage you to make your own systems with it fitting your specific game.

If you are looking for a ready-made solution to plug into your project please have a look at:
- [DialogueNodes](https://github.com/nagidev/DialogueNodes), which appears to use a very similar approach as mine.
- [Dialogic](https://github.com/dialogic-godot/dialogic), a very popular dialogue engine used in several commercial games.
